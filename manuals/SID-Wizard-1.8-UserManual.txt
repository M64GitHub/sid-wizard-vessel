This is a shorter revised version of the
SID-Wizard User Manual now in TXT format
so all quirks and complexities coming 
with PDF are excluded now, and it can be
read on real C64 as well. Press cursor
up/down to scroll up/down, and press /

======================================
I. Introduction of SID-Wizard and SID
======================================

SID-Wizard is a music-tracker applica-
tion for the Commodore 64 computer's
audio-chip called SID. It has many ad-
vanced features not found in other trac-
kers, hovewer I took many ideas from the
best C64 music editors like Goattracker,
SDI, X-SID, SID-Factory, JCH Editor,etc.

Main features of SID-Wizard:
-36 Instruments (30 in 2SID, 26 in 3SID)
-8 subtunes (only 2 in 2SID, 1 in 3SID)
-100 250byte patterns (105 in 2SID/3SID)
-Each instrument has own distinct tables
-Each instrument has own Hard-Restart
-Calculated vibrato (4 types) & slide
-Up to 8x framespeed (400Hz SID-control)
-ChordTable with direct Note-entry mode
-Keyboard-tracking (note-dependent filt)
-Support for different tempos on tracks
-3 simultaneous pattern-effects in track
-Gate-off entries in instrument-tables
-Scalable player (from 'bare' to extra)
-Music (SWM) compatible through versions
-Export formats like .SID and Executable
-Goattracker-like concept and keys
-Oscilloscope & pulsew./cutoff displays
-Selectable pre-set colour-themes
-DMC/SDI/Janko key-layout approaches too
-NTSC and Drean machine-type support
-MIDI/XM file-conversion via SWMconvert
-Goattracker SNG importer 'sng2swm.exe'
-Saving editor-settings to a config-file
-One-step "Undo" for patt./orderl./ins.
-Sound-FX support (SFX, Check doc's end)
-Collection of 324 example instruments
-Tunings: Verdi-tuning, Just-intonation
-MIDI-in (poly/mono,velo-sense),devices:
 HerMIDI,Sequential,Passport/Syntech,JMS
 Datel/Siel/CLAB,NameSoft,Maplin,MoogSP.
-MIDI-sync output (start/stop/clock)
-2SID ('.sws') & 3SID ('.swt') versions
-Independent Orderlist-marks (C=+SPACE)
-Separator 'NOP' in Orderlist with ID
-Insert entire orderlist column (C=+DEL)
-SWP - relocatable musicdata and player
-Tape-slowdown effect support in player


If you're interested in sound-sythesis
and the SID-chip you can read a bit more
in SID-Wizard 1.4 User Manual. But let's
see the registers of SID in a nutshell:

 00-01 07-08 0E-0F :Pitch low&high bytes
                    (low byte;high byte)
 02-03 09-0A 10-11 :Pulsewidth registers
                    (low byte;hi-nybble)
  $04   $0B   $12  :Waveform+control reg
                   (test,ring,sync,gate)
 05-06 0C-0D 13-14 :ADSR envelope reg.
                    (Att,Decay;Sust,Rel)
      $15-$16 :Filter cutoff frequency
               (low 3 bits; high 8 bits)
        $17   :Filter Resonance & Switch
               (Reso.nybble,Ch3,Ch2,Ch1)
        $18   :Filter Band / Volume reg.
               (Band nybble, Vol.nybble)


========================
II. Usage of SID-Wizard
========================

1.Startup-menu:
---------------
 You can select between these 
 player-routine types at startup:

 Normal: It probably has everything you
         will need: Calculated vibratos,
         Detune,Chord,Transpose, instru-
         ment octave,WF-ARP speed,Pulse/
         Filt.reset OFF, keyboard-track,
         11bit filter, tempo-programs,
         vibrato types, HR-types, frame1
         setting, note-off tableindex, 
         subtune-jump, zeropage-restore
        
 Medium: Smaller player-size but lacks: 
         vibrato-type,hard-restart type,
         frame1 setting,PW keybrd-track,
         note-off index, subtune-jump FX
         and zeropage save/restore 
        
 Light: Even smaller & consumes less 
        rastertime, but lacks also:
        Calculated vibrato & slide, De-
        tune, Chord-table, Transpose FX,
        Instrument-octave, WF-arp.speed,
        PW/Filt.reset OFF, keyboard-trk,
        11bit filter, tempo-programs
        
 Extra: Based on 'Normal', adds extras:
        (takes more memory & rastertime)
        program-tables never skipped,
        FiltSwitch-Reso.FX, Ghost regis-
        ters, fast tempo (0..2), vibrato
        is not lost after pitch-slide,
        note/track Delay pattern-FX
        
 Bare: Very restricted, significantly 
       smaller size, less than "Light".
       Lacks: subtune-support,multispeed
       support, external volume-setting,
       filter-shift FX, orderlist-FX,
       portamento in note-column, WF-ar-
       peggio NOP $80, vibrato-rate FX,
       filter/detune/WF small effects

 Demo: Includes features that are most
       likely needed for demos/intros. 
       Lacks:subtune-support,filtershift
       portamento in note-column, vibra-
       to frequency-FX, SmallFX for: 
       filter,detune,waveform/ring/sync.
       No extras like octave,chords,
       calculated vibrato & vib.types,
       gateoff-program,keyboard-track,
       No setting for HardRest./frame1.

 *If none of these pre-set values fit 
  your needs you can refine them in file
  /sources/settings.cfg and recompile 
  SID-Wizard with your own settings.
 *2SID version of SID-Wizard uses ghost-
  registers in all types of players.
  
 For PAL machines you can select an al-
 ternative pitch-tuning system in Start-
 up menu: Verdi tuning is equal-tempered
 but uses A4=432Hz as base-note, while
 Just-intonation even has note-intervals
 based on integer ratios to produce pure
 intervals in key of C. (not other keys)

 Drean machine tuning is auto-selected.

2.User Interface (and navigation keys)
--------------------------------------
 You have to use key-combinations to do
 tasks in SID-Wizard. Numbers are given 
 in hexadecimal 1..F format everywhere. 
 CRSR-keys can now go through ins.panel.

 The top-border part displays the logo
 with SW version-number and player-type,
 Octave, Playback-time, Rastertime, Auto
 advance amount, Pulsewidth- and Filter-
 cutoff bars, and finally Channel3 wave.
 
 Pattern-editor (call with F5 key):
  The largest part of the screen where 
  you can put notes & effects for the 3 
  tracks of SID. A patternrow looks like
  
  Column1   Column2     Column3 Column4
  Note/Fx Instrument/Fx  Effect Fx-Value
  
  The notes can be typed in the selected
  octave by 2 rows in normal SW-layout:

  Upper octave:   2 3   5 6 7   9 0
  (SDI's layout) Q W E R T Y U I O P @ *

  Lower octave:     S D   G H J   L
                   Z X C V B N M , .
  
  DMC-layout:    W E   T Y U   O P
                A S D F G H J K L :

  JANKO-layout: Chromatic/non-diatonic, 
   notes found on F,4,K,8 keys as well.

 Orderlist (call with F6 = Shift+F5):
  In the bottom-border you can organize
  the sequence how the patterns are to 
  be played after each other on tracks.
  Some effects can also be given above
  $80, see values later in section III.
  First track's playback-start mark is
  seen in position-numbers' colouring,
  while individual track play-marks can
  be seen as small underlines. 
 
 Instrument-panel (call with F7 key):
  On the right-side of the screen the
  instruments can be edited. You can se-
  lect instrument to edit with +/- keys.
  Each instrument has a number and you
  can give them a name as well. See the
  content of the tables in section III.
 
 At the rightmost side of the screen are
 chord-table (call with C=+F5 or C=+K) 
 and the tempo-program table (C=+F7/F8)

3.Menu: File operations, configuration
--------------------------------------
 Menu and file-operations can be called
 with F8 key (Shift+F7). Press Esc/STOP
 to exit the Menu or file-dialog. You
 can save/load worktunes with SWM exten-
 sion, while SWI stands for instruments.
 (You can check the author-information 
 and player-type abbreviation N/M/L/E/B
 of the loaded tune in orderlist's posi-
 tion-row right after loading or by cal-
 ling the menu with F8 key.)
  Press RETURN on the menupoints to set 
 or adjust parameters. One exception is
 default pattern-length which can be set
 with +/- and sets the unused patterns' 
 lengths when you kill/load/save a tune.

  To activate a MIDI-device first select
 its type with RETURN, then select the 
 MIDI-channel you want to receive from.
 (Press Shift+RETURN to disable MIDI.)
  If a MIDI-device is set successfully
 you can see ':' before its name, else
 a '!' notifies you about the issues.
  Attention: Most MIDI-devices which use
 $DE00..$DFFF will cause a clash/freeze 
 if you have a cartridge attached on Ex-
 pansion port. I don't know a workaround
 except using HerMIDI which doesn't use
 the Expansion-port kept for cartridges.
  MIDI beat-clock output is generated on
 devices that have MIDI-output, so now
 you can synchronize other sequencers as
 well as start/stop their playback.

 Base-addresses of SID2 and SID3 can be
 set to all possible values with +/- but
 the most commonly used addresses come 
 first. The setting gets performed when 
 you exit from menu or restart tune.(F1)
 (Clash with cartridges can also happen 
  if you try to set $DE00..$DFE0 here.)
 
 From version 1.5 SID-Wizard no longer
 saves editor-specific settings into the
 workfile: you can save your settings
 with 'SAVE CONFIG' menupoint into a 
 file called '@SWCONFIG.PRG'. Then it's
 loaded at next startup automatically,
 if succeeds it is seen in startup-menu.
 Otherwise you'll see a '?' next to this
 menupoint. (If even saving the config 
 was unsuccessful you'll see a '!' here)

1.Instrument-parameters
-----------------------
 Main instrument-settings:
  ADSR - If Sustain=8, MIDI-velocity=ON
  ADHR - ADSR value for hard-restart
  Frame1 waveform (turn on with RETURN)

  $FE (-E) End of tune, stop playback
  $FF (-F) Jump to position given by the
 following number,above $80:Jump subtune
 *Orderlist must not begin with $FE/$FF!
 (Separator is seen as '--' to '-D', it
  does nothing but eases visualization.)

4.Chord-table values
--------------------
 $00..$7D  Rel. pitch up (by halfnotes)
 $FF..$80  Rel. pitch-shift downwards
   $7E     Return from chord to Arp-tbl.

 ChordTable now can be edited in 2 ways:
 the 'Note-mode' is selectable: You can 
 set the base/root note of a chord out-
 side of the chord-table, then the notes
 of the chord IN the chordtable. Editing
 mode (Space) should be selected to type
 (More convenient method than the number
  based.Playback also sets the basenote)

5.Tempo-table values
--------------------
 $00..$7F  Tempo for one pattern-row


========================================
IV. SID-Maker,converters,player-use,MIDI
========================================

SID-Maker is an important addon for
SID-Wizard, it can create various for-
mats from the saved SWM tune: Normal,
Raw, Executable and SID. (If you used a
':' in the author-info field it will be-
have as a separator between author-name 
and tune-title in the SID export.)
 Each format has different settings, you
can select a different player-type for
all if you want, and relocation-address.
SID-export has one more setting, if the
SID-type to be set for old/new. (Player-
type and SIDtype defaults autodetected.)
 There are additional SID2/SID3 address
settings in 2SID/3SID versions,it works
as in the editor: most common addresses
come first. All export-formats need it.

SWMconvert.exe is a non-C64 addon, you
can convert from/to XM/MID formats with
a degree of precision. It's used to con-
vert between .P00/.prg or .S00/.sid for-
mat in case you save from VICE-emulator.
(Also for .SWM to/from .SWS conversion.)

sng2swm can convert Goattracker's .sng
workfiles to SID-Wizard's .swm format.
You can find some examples on the disk.

The exported tune (normal/raw/sid) can
be included in your programs in the usu-
al way, LoadAddress of the tune is the
initialization subroutine, subtune must
be set in accumulator before calling it.
LoadAddress+3 is the playback-routine 
to be called in every frame. 
LoadAddress+6 is the multispeed-call if 
you have multispeed tune. 
And LoadAddress+9 is the external volu-
me setting. (Put volume into accu before
you call this short routine.)
 SFX (Sound-FX) can be triggered on 
channel 3 from your program by calling
LoadAddress+12, if you exported the tune
with the special SID-Maker-SFX. All FXes
are essentially instruments, they over-
ride channel3 notes during execution.
You have to set the CPU-registers first:
X=Note, Y=Instrument, A=Length (frames)
( Check '/sources/SFX-example' folder. )
 SWP relocatable musicdata and player
can be exported by SID-Maker-SWP. To 
init an SWP tune, set its load-address
lo- and hi-bytes in X and Y, and subtune
in A, then call the special SWP player's
init- and play-routines as usual.
 Tape-slowdown simulation FX and SFX are
assembled into SID-Maker-SWP-FX. To set 
slowdown (in halftone-steps), put slow-
down value 0..24 into Accu., then call
LoadAddress+15 and the tune slows down.

You can see the estimated rastertime du-
ring composing and the final measure in
the executable export. The memory foot-
prints of the different player-types are
displayed in the Startup-menu of editor.

Supported MIDI-commands:Stop,Start,Reset
SoundOff,ProgramChange,Brightness,Volume
Note,PitchWheel,ModWheel,Aftertouch,(in
monophonic-mode only on cursor channel)

Don't be surprised if you see some short
screen-flashing in the top & bottom bor-
ders when you use MIDI-devices. That's 
caused by the IRQ that MIDI-cartridges 
generate in arbitrary times and so they
disturb raster-interrupt of SID-Wizard.

In case you'd have an unfortunate crash
due to external issues (drive,etc.) you 
can restart SID-Wizard safely after a 
warm reset by 'SYS 2061' command.

I hope You'll enjoy using SID-Wizard...
